📖 About the Project
The Travel Recommendation System is a machine learning–based project designed to recommend travel destinations to users based on their preferences. The project helps users discover suitable places to visit by analyzing factors such as interests, travel type, and other preferences.

This project was developed as a beginner-level academic project by Akansha Rohilla and Harshit to understand the working of recommendation systems.

Demonstrates recommendation system concepts

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details about travel destinations and user preferences.

Basic preprocessing was performed to prepare the data for recommendations.

⚙️ How It Works
User provides travel preferences

Input data is processed

Recommendation algorithm analyzes preferences

Suitable travel destinations are suggested

🧠 Recommendation Technique
Uses a simple content-based or similarity-based recommendation approach

Recommendations are generated by matching user preferences with destination features
